Task: - The customer (start-up) wants to deploy EC2 instances in more than one region and wants EC2 instances in different VPCs to be able to communicate securely. 

sample layout: -
1.	Deploy a VPC each in us-east-1 and us-west-2. (This is a requirement too)
2.	The us-east-1 VPC will have CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/16.
3.	The us-west-2 VPC will have CIDR range of 192.168.0.0/16.
4.	There will be two subnets in the us-east-1 VPC with the following CIDR ranges: 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24.
5.	There will be one subnet in the us-west-2 VPC with the following CIDR range: 192.168.1.0/24.
6.	You'll deploy a VPC peering connection between both VPCs. (You'll initiate the peering connection from us-east-1).
7.	You'll be creating/modifying VPC route tables accordingly so that traffic can flow between the two VPCs.
8.	Create and attach internet gateways to both VPCs.
9.	Create security groups which allow incoming traffic on TCP ports 22 and 8080. You'll also need to ensure security groups in each region allow traffic on all ports from the IP range of the peered VPC or at least its subnets.
